  let n be a fixed number and i be an interval,
  than n/n will be equal to 1. whereas i/i will not be equal to 1.  --(1)

  in part1 equivalent resistance is calculated using (R1R2)/(R2+R1) whereas in
  part2 equivalent resistance is calculated using 1/(1/R1 + 1/R2). --(2)

  in part1 variables with uncertain value have more occurance than in part2.
  considering  case --(1) we can see that i/i is not equal to 1 so with more
  occurances error will be more that is why part2 is more accurate than part1

  An imroved interval-arithmetic package can be developed. But still it will have some error
